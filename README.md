# Restricted-Hartree-Fock
**Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) method**

This program mainly references the **Notebook [Re: Starting from Scratch in the e-World (I) HF Approximation, STO-3G Basis Set, and SCF Calculation](https://bohrium.dp.tech/notebooks/76266786918)**. and the teaching codes of **[BaoPeng](https://github.com/baopengbp)** <br>

It utilizes the `libcint` integral library to compute various integrals and directly solves the generalized eigenvalue problem using `eigh`, avoiding the discussion of **Löwdin Orthogonalization**
